    "For the purposes of this project, we are interested in posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the community questions. Users submit `Show HN` posts to show the community a project, product or something of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we are going to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "   - Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "   - Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Please note that the data set we are working with has been reduced from nearly 300,000 rows to about 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments. Then random sampling from the remaining submissions was utilized to create the final data set.**\n",

    "In this project, we analyzed `Ask HN` posts to determine which type of post received the most comments on average. We determined that `Ask HN` receive more on average and used that data to analyze which times of the day received the most comments on average. We could that 15:00 (3:00 PM EST) was the time of the day that received the most comments on average, by quite a bit. We would reccomend that when posting on Hacker News it would be best to utilize `Ask HN` posts and to post between 3:00 PM EST and 4:00 PM EST.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that the data set that we analyzed excludes posts that did not have any comments. Additionally a random sample was taken out of the remaining posts to make the data more manageable. Taking that background information into account, it would be more accurate for us to conclude that of the posts that received comments, `Ask HN` posts received more comments on average than `Show HN` posts, and `Ask HN` posts created during the 15:00 hour (EST) of the day received the most comments on average.**"
